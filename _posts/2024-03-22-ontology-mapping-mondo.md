The [Monarch Disease Ontology (MONDO)](https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/) aims to harmonize disease definitions across the biomedical landscape. By integrating various disease resources into a single, coherent ontology, MONDO provides a unified framework for disease representation. This is particularly beneficial for research into multiple chronic conditions (MCC), where consistent and accurate disease mapping is crucial. MONDO's approach facilitates better data sharing, analysis, and understanding of disease relationships, making it an invaluable resource for researchers and clinicians working on ontology mapping and the study of chronic conditions.
