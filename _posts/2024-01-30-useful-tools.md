1. **Protocols for Secure Genomic Computation** - A library containing a proof-of-concept implementation of several protocols for privacy-preserving genome computation. This is a research prototype not intended for production-level code, under the GPL license. [Visit Repository](https://github.com/dwu4/genome-privacy).

2. **BiORAM-SGX** - Stores personal genome data with encryption, decrypting it only on Enclave using Path ORAM for quick and secure access. It's designed for clients analyzing personal genome data, data owners, and SGX servers. [Visit Repository](https://github.com/diwata11/BiORAM-SGX).

3. **DP-MIA: Differential Privacy Protection for Genomic Data** - Focuses on the growing concern of genome privacy in machine learning, addressing the risk of membership inference attacks on genomic data. [Visit Repository](https://github.com/work-hard-play-harder/DP-MIA).

4. **LDP-genome-statistics: Privacy-Preserving Genomic Statistics** - Discusses privacy-preserving methods for genomic statistics, including the assignment of privacy budgets to different attributes. [Visit Repository](https://github.com/ay0408/LDP-genome-statistics).

5. **PRIVACY PRESERVING AND ROBUST WATERMARKING ON SEQUENTIAL GENOME DATA (PPRW_SGD_BPLDP)** - A project for privacy-preserving and robust watermarking on sequential genome data using belief propagation and local differential privacy. [Visit Repository](https://github.com/acoksuz/PPRW_SGD_BPLDP).

6. **GenomeAnnotation: Best Practices and Tools** - Although not directly focused on privacy, it evaluates methods for genome annotation with an end goal of providing best practice workflows, potentially relevant for privacy-conscious genome analysis. [Visit Repository](https://github.com/harvardinformatics/GenomeAnnotation).

7. **genome-maps** - An open-source, high-performance web-based HTML5 genome browser that can be customized to browse user data like BAM and VCF files, which may include privacy considerations. [Visit Repository](https://github.com/opencb/genome-maps).

8. **privvg: Differential Privacy for Graphs** - Offers differential privacy on variation graphs, allowing the capture of complex models and aggregate data resources with formal privacy guarantees. [Visit Repository](https://github.com/pangenome/privvg).

9. **SetDiffServer.cpp** - Part of the genome-privacy project, contributing to secure genomic computation protocols. [Visit Repository](https://github.com/genome-privacy/SetDiffServer.cpp).

10. **kasaquan/genome_privacy** - A semester project implementing a cryptography scheme for genome privacy. [Visit Repository](https://github.com/kasaquan/genome_privacy).
