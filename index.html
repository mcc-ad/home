### Project Description

The rapid progress in genome sequencing has led to significant data collection, opening new avenues for understanding disease associations and human evolution. However, the sensitive nature of genomic data raises privacy concerns, limiting access to datasets for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to a few large groups. Our project proposes a sandbox environment that enables collaborative research while addressing these privacy concerns. This environment allows researchers to share data in a privacy-preserving manner, facilitating collaborative GWAS without compromising data integrity or participant privacy. By developing novel algorithms for quality control and reproducibility in federated datasets, our framework aims to democratize genomic data sharing and accelerate scientific discovery in genomics.
