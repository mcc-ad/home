# An end-to-end informatics framework to study Multiple Chronic Conditions (MCC)’s impact on Alzheimer’s disease using harmonized electronic health records

## Project Overview
The project, "An end-to-end informatics framework to study Multiple Chronic Conditions (MCC)’s impact on Alzheimer’s disease using harmonized electronic health records," led by UTHealth Houston, Mayo clinics and University of Florida, is dedicated to transforming Alzheimer's disease research by improving the interoperability and utility of electronic health records (EHR). 

## Problem Statement
The research in Alzheimer's disease is increasingly dependent on the analysis of electronic health records to understand multi-chronic conditions (MCC) associated with the disease. However, the lack of interoperability between different healthcare systems and the extensive manual annotation required for data extraction have significantly hindered the efficiency and scope of research. These challenges not only slow down scientific discovery but also limit the potential for collaborative studies. This project addresses these critical issues by proposing a novel framework that enhances EHR data utility and interoperability, thereby accelerating Alzheimer's disease research without compromising data integrity or patient privacy.
